### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Derek Papierski
#### Student at University of Michigan-Dearborn



I am a former residential carpenter who found a passion for software. After leaving the construction business, I enrolled back in college where I am currently pursuing a dual major in Computer Science & Data Science at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. I am eager to collaborate with others and learn about building great software!
